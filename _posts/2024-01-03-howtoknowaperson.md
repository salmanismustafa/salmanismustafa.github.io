What a solid read to start the year off with. Unlike a lot of things I’ve read in the recent years, the focus of this work is empathy. It is understanding others more deeply, beyond how they fit into our own stories. To take an interest in their stories on a level that isn’t superficial.

There aren’t any groundbreaking revelations here. Just paths to being more open, vulnerable and caring of other people.

I appreciate the impact of the mindset shift this book has had on me. I am trying to be a better listener, a better storyteller, more open in my relationships, kinder and less judgmental towards strangers.

They say our relationships are the defining factor in our overall sense of meaning and happiness in life. I have often found myself neglecting their importance and focusing on my own desires and needs. This book makes me want to change that.
