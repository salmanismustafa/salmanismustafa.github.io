4/5

I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. Simply written and well researched, this is a book with practical advice for anyone wanting improve their baseline health and also learn more about the inner workings of physiology and factors that contribute to longevity (and the lack of it).

I know Attia from his podcast and he’s blown up in the recent years for talking about longevity, but also openly criticizing modern medical practices for treating symptoms and not the underlying causes of disease. He shows disdain for the overspecialization in medicine that’s lead to an overmedicated population that has not had its steep decline in health properly addressed.

I found the discussion of the four horsemen diseases (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and Alzheimer’s) very interesting. I also enjoyed the sections on exercise, nutrition, sleep and mental health as his primary focuses of care for treating long term issues in human health.

Some highlights:

‘Longevity is meaningless if your life sucks.
Nothing else about longevity is really worth much without some degree of happiness, fulfillment and connection to others.’

‘Deep sleep is when the brain clears out its cache of short-term memories in the hippocampus and selects important ones for long term storage’

‘Data demonstrate caloric restriction slows aging in a primate species’

‘Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt - Richard Feynman’

‘Our hands are powerful enough to crush the juice out of a lemon, yet dexterous enough to play a Beethoven sonata on the piano’

‘Stability is about safe and powerful transmission of force through muscles and bones’

‘Learn and understand how your body interacts with the world - this is what stability is about’

‘Think of the centenarian decathlon as the 10 most important tasks you will want to be able to do for the rest of your life’

‘Focusing on steady endurance exercise improves mitochondrial efficiency’

‘Health insurance companies won’t pay a doctor very much to tell a patient to change the way they eat or to exercise more’

‘You must be willing to change ingrained habits, accept new challenges, and venture outside your comfort zone if necessary’

‘Every single thing we do, in medicine and in life, is based on some calculation of risk versus reward’
